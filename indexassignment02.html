<h1>the story in the book
</h1>
<h3>chapter 1
</h3>
<p>molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. on her desk,lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New scientist,</i>and all the other
scientific joumals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy fo On the road. It had been molly's favourite book since college,and the longer she
spent in these four walls the mor she felt she needed to free. 
</p>
<p>she had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that" work is the refuge pf people who have
nothing better to do".although many considered her poneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly
<i>did</i> think she had something better to do.</p>
